Their study reveals ways that community members struggle to define the problem and work together as they gather, share, and understand data relevant to that problem. The authors argue that the primary goal of action research related to environmental risk should be to identify and support the strategies used by community members rather than to educate the public. The authors maintain that this approach must be supported by a thorough investigation of basic rhetorical issues (audience, genre, stases, invention), and they illustrate how they used this approach in their study.},

Four rhetorical concepts describe variation among this subforum's comments: William Keith's distinction between `discussion' and `debate,' William Covino's distinction between good and bad magic, Kelly Oliver's notion of ethical response/ ability, and Krista Ratcliffe's notion of rhetorical listening. Using a three-part taxonomy based on these concepts, we argue that collaborative climate change deliberation exists and that forum participation guidelines can promote productive styles of engagement.},

The ``failure''; of these risk communication models has led, some scholars argue, to a number of ethical and communicative problems. We seek to extend the critique, arguing that ``risk''; is socially constructed. The claim for the social construction of risk has significant implications for both risk communication and the roles of technical communicators in risk situations. We frame these implications as a ``critical rhetoric''; of risk communication that (1) dissolves the separation of risk assessment from risk communication to locate epistemology within communicative processes; (2) foregrounds power in risk communication as a way to frame ethical audience involvement; (3) argues for the technical communicator as one possessing the research and writing skills necessary for the complex processes of constructing and communicating risk.},

Our mixed-methods research examines whether the application of certain PL guidelines affects the comprehension and perceptions of readers of environmental policy documents. Results show that the presence of pronouns affects inferential comprehension of environmental impact statement summaries (EIS summaries), but that the effect varies with the reader's education level. Further, headings in question phrasing affect a reader's perception of familiarity and reliability of EIS summaries. A reader's perceptions of EIS summaries and attitudes toward the organizations creating the documents are also affected by overall design features. PL guidelines on the use of pronouns and question headings are not fully supported by our research and need further validation with regard to comprehension. This article ends with a call for further research.},

  abstract = {Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a tool for providing systematic assessment to identify environmental, social, and economic impacts of significant developments. Through a series of technical assessments, public-facing reports are produced, including non-technical summaries of larger reports- these documents communicate assessment outcomes to non-technical public stakeholders during consultation. Consultation approaches have stagnated and achieve minimal feedback with a notable age-bias based on low turn-outs at consultation events. Digital technology is being promoted to create a widely accessible, engaging, information source to aid public knowledge and awareness of EIA outcomes. In recent years, progressive digital reporting approaches such as Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) StoryMaps, purpose-built web-solutions and bespoke-built websites, have been adopted by environmental and engineering consultancies to digitalise EIA public-facing reports. The 1998 Aarhus Convention sets out fundamental requirements for public participation within environmental decision-making, requiring inclusivity, accessibility and transparency. Consultation phases are increasingly utilising digitalised reports for their non-technical stakeholder audience, and therefore need to fulfil Aarhus requirements. This study explored the usability of digitalised public-facing documents. Interactive digital reports intended for a non-technical audience, using the interface formats ESRI StoryMaps, purpose-built web solutions and bespoke websites, were focused on due to their increasing use within public EIS reporting in engineering and environmental consultancies operating globally. Three research approaches were employed: a usability test of a purpose-built interactive digital document, interviews with digital EIA practitioners and a comparative cartographic and interface feature review. We found evidence of a digital divide between age groups and ability to effectively utilise a precedent digital report- with older users (aged 66+) less able to access information and avoid errors. Digital literacy on its own was not a reliable indicator of a user's ability to navigate a digital environment but is likely compounded by other factors such as cognitive function among older users. Practitioners saw opportunities in digitalised reports but recognised limitations in their value to some users. Current digital reporting practice presents initial usability issues, indicating direction for essential development towards a receptor-based, personalised, report.},

  abstract = {Based on a qualitative, ethnographic, observational case study approach, {$<$}em{$>$}Environmental Preservation and the Grey Cliffs Conflict{$<$}/em{$>$}presents an analysis of the conflict negotiation between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and a local community that struggled to address a deteriorating Corps-managed recreational lake area in Tennessee known as "Grey Cliffs." Viewing the dispute from the perspective of a new member of the community and a specialist in technical communication and professional writing, Kristin Pickering provides a unique perspective on this communication process. Though environmental degradation and unauthorized use threatened the Grey Cliffs recreational lake area to the point that the Corps considered closure, community members valued it highly and wanted to keep it open. The community near this damaged and crime-ridden area needed help rejuvenating its landscape and image, but the Corps and community were sharply divided on how to maintain this beloved geographic space because of the stakeholders' different cultural backgrounds and values, as well as the narratives used to discuss them. By co-constructing and aligning narratives, values, and ethos over time-a difficult and lengthy process-the Corps and community succeeded, and Grey Cliffs remains open to all. Focusing on field notes, participant interviews, and analysis of various texts created throughout the conflict, Pickering applies rhetorical analysis and a grounded theory approach to regulation, identity, sustainability, and community values to analyze this communication process. Illustrating the positive change that can occur when governmental organizations and rural communities work together to construct shared values and engage in a rhetoric of relationship that preserves the environment, {$<$}em{$>$}Environmental Preservation and the Grey Cliffs Conflict{$<$}/em{$>$} provides key recommendations for resolving environmental conflicts within local communities, especially for those working in technical and professional communication, organizational communication, environmental science, and public policy.},

  abstract = {The spaces in which public deliberation most often takes place are institutionally, technologically, and scientifically complex. In this article, we argue that in order to participate, citizens must be able to invent valued knowledge. This invention requires using complex information technologies to access, assemble, and analyze information in order to produce the professional and technical performances expected in contemporary civic forums. We argue for a civic rhetoric that expands to research the complicated nature of interface technologies, the inventional practices of citizens as they use these technologies, and the pedagogical approaches to encourage the type of collaborative and coordinated work these invention strategies require.},

  abstract = {While several studies have highlighted the potential and opportunities of digitalisation for EA, few have explored the perceptions of practitioners using a mixed-methods approach. This study took a close look at the role of advanced digital approaches, such as the introduction of artificial intelligence into EA practice. The research process was based on a literature review, focus group discussions and exploratory interviews with agencies, EA practitioners, researchers, associations and environmental groups. The process resulted in six categories of advanced solutions, covering challenges, opportunities and a classification of process steps in EA, based on different stakeholder perspectives and the state of research on digitalisation in environmental assessment. Despite the wealth of academic work on digitisation in EA, it became clear that the majority of practitioners in Austria and Germany were not familiar with advanced digital approaches and tools. While other planning disciplines are exploiting the potential of advanced digital tools, EA practitioners still share concerns about data quality, security, legal uncertainties, but also skills and know-how. The study reveals a discrepancy and need for training and confidence building. It seeks to contribute to the promotion of inter- \& transdisciplinary exchange involving the wider EA community.},
