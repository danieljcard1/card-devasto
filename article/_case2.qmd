Our second case focuses on the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's
(MPCA) efforts to design and fund a climate pollution reduction project.
As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. EPA's Climate Pollution
Reduction Grants (CPRG) program is a \$5 billion investment that
provides states, local governments, and Tribal Nations with resources to
implement projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other
harmful air pollution [@zotero-10578]. In collaboration with other state
agencies and stakeholders, the MPCA secured a planning grant in June
2023. The deliverables for this grant included a "Priority Climate
Action Plan" that provides "a focused list of near-term, high-priority,
implementation-ready measures to reduce climate pollution from
greenhouse gas emissions" [@kohlaschb, p. 8]. 

The PCPA includes a list of projects the agency would be ready to
implement. Submitting the plan made the MPCA eligible to apply for an
implementation grant, which would provide funding for one or more
projects identified in a Priority Climate Action Plan.

The MPCA's process for writing that action plan is our focus in this case.

More specifically, we focus on the MPCA's engagement activities as implemented via a [project-specific EngagementHQ webpage](https://engage.eqb.state.mn.us/climate-priorities) dedicated to "identifying priorities for federal climate funding".   

## Engagement HQ

EngagementHQ is a digital platform designed primarily for use by
government agencies. The "all-in-one digital engagement platform"
consists of a suite of features designed to help agencies design and
manage community engagement activities. Product descriptions and case
studies of EngagementHQ emphasize its ability to promote two-way
dialogue, using phrases like deliberative dialogue, open discussion,
civil debate, conversation, co-design [@2021].

EngagementHQ serves as something akin to a content management system
where government communicators can design and facilitate communication. 

Agency communicators can provide valuable project context on the landing
page for the project. In this case, the landing page serves as a hub for
the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's efforts to secure a Climate
Pollution Reduction Grant from the Environmental Protection Agency.

The top of the landing page features text describing the details of the
grant program, what the agency has already done, and what will happen
next in the project. At the end of this text readers are invited to sign
up for email updates about the project or email a coordinator directly
if they have questions. Links to share the page via email or popular
social media platforms are also featured.

To the right, a graphic representation of the project lifecycle lists
phases of the project and the estimated timeframe for each phase.
Checkmark icons indicate which phases have been completed.

Together, the project overview text and lifecycle panel provide
high-level project context to orient participants.

A files repository allows government communicators to provide in depth
information and additional background. A files panel below the project
lifecyle features a list of materials including video recordings and
associated slides from a series of webinars in which project
facilitators provided project information and answered participant
questions. 

![Repository of files in
EngagementHQ](assets/engagementhq-files-repo.PNG)

These webinars serve as a digital alternative or supplement to public
meetings where project facilitators might brief community members on the
project and seek input. In this case, these webinars serve as key moment
to frame subsequent engagement around a set of shared, salient facts.

In addition to providing data, the agency directs participants to data sources they believe will be compelling to the funding agency. For example, they note that the EPA reviewers expect projects to have a positive impact on disadvantaged communities, as defined by [Justice40 Initiative criteria](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/methodology) and the Inflation Reduction Act's Disadvataged Communities Map [@zotero-10588; @usepa2023]. 

Participants are directed to access maps of disadvantaged communities in Minnesota via EJScreen, the EPA's Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool [@zotero-10590].

```

Additional files are added throughout the project, such as an outline of potential ideas early in the project and a draft of Priority Climate Action Plan.   

## Survey

The team uses the survey feature to collect data on values and
preferences to ostensibly inform which projects they move forward with
and provide empirical support for those choices. The Climate Pollution Reduction Grant team opened a survey to gather project ideas within the priority categories they identified. As the team articulates in the final Priority Climate Action Plan, this survey "garnered over 350 submissions from local governments, community-based organizations, state agencies, academic institutions, businesses, and interested individuals, spanning from general ideas to detailed project proposals...these helped inform the measures that are now integrated into the PCAP" (p.17, @kohlaschb). 

## Ideas board

Some of the features in EngagementHQ explicitly promote dialogue between
government communicators and participants, but also enable dialogue across participants. 

![Ideas board in EngagementHQ](assets/engagementhq-ideas.PNG)

The team used an "ideas board" to invite participants to share their ideas for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike a survey response that goes directly to the CPRG team, short "ideas" are posted to the board become cards in a grid for other participants to read, like, share, or respond to.  

## Forum board

The team also used a "forum board" to invite participants to share ideas. While the prompt is similar to the ideas board, this format is presumably better suited for more involved posts. 

![Forum board in EngagementHQ](assets/engagementhq-forum.PNG)

Here again, participants are able to respond to others' posts.

Overall, we see the MPCA use the features of EngagementHQ to not only to provide participants with information in a variety of formats but also to facilitate exchange among participants.
