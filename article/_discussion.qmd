While science communication is often discussed as an effort to make complex, science-y things more approachable for "lay" audiences, we might instead view science communication as essentially an effort to make what an expert community knows available and actionable for those outside that expert community. This view shifts the audience of science communication from passive receivers of information to active participants with goals. In so doing, this perspective brings science communication closer to the realm of technical communication, where the primary focus is not merely on making information accessible, but on making it useful for people with problems to address or tasks to complete. 

In the two cases of public engagement we’ve discussed, digital tools seem designed to provide stakeholders with additional ways to access information. In a broad sense, these artifacts certainly allow more people to access project information and subsequently participate in the decision-making process than physical meetings alone. For example, as a web-based artifact, BEP’s digital EIS makes use of linking to provide access to a wealth of data; it also makes use of GIS to incorporate information-rich, interactive maps that are not typically part of traditional EISs. Relevant agencies and representatives at the state and local levels are likely to appreciate having access to all that data alongside the modularized written content that the digital EIS provides. For non-expert participants, the visual format might be easier to engage with than a 100-1000 page technical report. Indeed, the infrastructure firm that designed the platforms for both the digital EIS and virtual reading room says the technologies will improve stakeholder engagement by “presenting highly technical information in a user-friendly online and interactive format…[leading] to improved outcomes for communities worldwide” [2].

But a closer look at the events and artifacts that make up these periods of public engagement (e.g., the webinar, the virtual reading room, the reports to be reviewed) suggest primarily one-way conversations in which information is being delivered. For example, consider the virtual reading room: an online, interactive space that visually approximates a poster session (see figure X). Created as part of an effort to provide “stakeholders with a safe and effective way to understand the proposed project and provide input despite social distancing requirements,” the virtual reading room is visually rich, available 24/7 with internet access, and mobile-friendly [3]. While the amount of information a viewer has access to is extensive, it doesn’t replicate the most important function of a poster session or open house -- dialogue with humans. The use of forums and idea boards in EngagementHQ have more potential to facilitate dialogue. Rather than provide participants with a digital comment box, these tools allow agency managers to create a space where participants can share information and express preferences not only to the agency but also to fellow stakeholders. 

St. Amant argues that advocacy is at its core about access to information, but suggests that we think about access to information as involving two interlocking parts: “The first is availability-- that is, the sources of information are available for us to consult as needed… the second concept is comprehensibility-- or information is presented in a way we can easily understand and act on” [5]. In this, St. Amant positions technical communicators as ideal individuals to foster advocacy by designing materials and conveying highly technical information to a range of audiences. 
TC scholars Moore and Elliot (2016) suggest that public engagement in the context of public planning projects be viewed not only as participatory design but also as a critical opportunity for planners to collect data to inform the design of the final project. They advocate viewing engagement processes like the ones discussed here as efforts to design “listening infrastructures.” Public engagement is often viewed as being more about questions of value than questions of value and action than questions of fact-- place of politics, not science. We contend that both planners and participants make and contest arguments about what we ought to do based on the questions and answers of science. Further, Moore and Elliot’s contention that public engagement is at least in part about gathering data of participants values, preferences, and tacit knowledge positions the entire process as science2-- as doing democracy scientifically. 

In a subsequent article, Moore (2017) advances a vision of the technical communicator as participant, facilitator, and designer. Following Moore, we contend the engagement planner-as-technical communicator is tasked with not only providing participants with relevant scientific information, but also with designing a space in which relevant science can effectively inform decisions.
