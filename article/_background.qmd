As researchers trained at the intersection of technical communication
and the rhetoric of science, technology, and medicine, we have thought a
lot about the boundaries of scientific communication, technical
communication, and science communication.

## Communication: Science, Scientific, and Technical

Science communication is commonly understood as communication aimed at
non-expert audiences such as the general public, policymakers, and
media, with the goal of making scientific knowledge approachable,
enhancing public understanding of science, and influencing
decision-making. Prototypical examples of this include Neil DeGrasse
Tyson's [StarTalk radio program](https://startalkmedia.com/), which
discusses complex astronomical phenomena in an engaging way; public
science museum exhibits, like those about paleontology that visually
explain the prehistoric world; and articles in publications like
Scientific American that address current scientific issues such as
climate change for broader audiences.

Scientific communication focuses on communicating with peers within the
scientific community to advance science through the sharing of research
findings and discussion of theories. Typical forms of scientific
communication include peer-reviewed research articles that detail new
studies and discoveries, presentations at scientific conferences where
researchers share and discuss their work, and academic posters that
succinctly present research findings at gatherings of experts.

Technical communication is designed for both specialized and
non-specialized audiences, aiming to make specialized information or
technology comprehensible and usable. This can include detailed
instruction manuals that guide users through the setup and use of
devices, comprehensive reports that communicate the results and
implications of technical assessments, and thorough documentation such
as software user guides or API documentation, which are essential for
understanding and effectively utilizing technology.

: Conventional understandings of science, scientific, and technical
communication {.striped .hover .bordered}

While these conventional understandings surely have some utility, the
distinctions they rely on are often vague in practice. For example,
consider the distinction between scientific knowledge and specialized
information: are the media, policymakers, and citizens not users of the
evidence science produces? Does making that specialized information
comprehensible and usable constitute science communication or technical
communication?

Consider also the notion of peer, specialized, or technical audiences:
At what point are researchers in adjacent disciplines or non-academic
organizations no longer peers? Are research articles published in the
Journal of Environmental Management, written by ecologists and read by
both environmental economists and government natural resource managers,
scientific communication or science communication?

Finally, consider definitions of technical communication that hinge on
the use of technology: Does the use of communication technology to make
information comprehensible and usable position both scientific and
science communication as also forms of technical communication?

The bounds of science itself are notoriously difficult to draw (take our
word for it or type "demarcation problem" in your search engine of
choice), and we believe the same is true for technical, technology, and
expert. Fortunately, our goal is not to resolve these problems but
rather simply to muddy the waters enough to suggest that: 1) public
engagement with policy making is a site of science communication,
broadly construed and 2) this communicative practice is also
productively viewed through the lens of technical communication.

## Science Communication in/and/as Public Engagement

Public engagement in policy making may on its face appear to have little
connection to science communication as it's often understood, so in this
section we briefly articulate two ways we see public engagement as
relevant to science communication.

### What is public engagement?

For our purposes here, public engagement refers to the processes and
mechanisms by which the public participates in democratic policy- or
decision-making. Public engagement as we define it here can be formal or
informal and optional or mandated. Scholars in a range of fields as well
as government practitioners use various terms to describe both public
(civic, community, stakeholder, citizen) and engagement (participation,
involvement, inclusion, consultation), but generally speaking these are
all efforts to improve the transparency, legitimacy, and quality of
government decisions through communication between decision makers and
those affected by the decisions they make [@moore2017].

In other words, we might see public engagement processes as attempts to
enact the ideals of deliberative or participatory democracy, where
participation and dialogue are understood as central to good decisions.

### Public engagement as a site of science communication

@keith2014 argued that for Dewey and Deweyans, science and democracy are
flip sides of the same coin. "Science, properly understood, is a
democratic enterprise, and democracy is a scientific one" (p. 34). In
this view, science involves open inquiry, debate, and collaboration. It
isn't controlled by a single authority, but rather depends on collective
contributions and rigorous examination. Science values diversity of
thought, peer review, and transparency---principles that align with
those in a democratic society where people can freely express their
opinions, challenge authority, and contribute to shared knowledge.
Similarly, democracy is a process of continuous inquiry and
experimentation, akin to the scientific method. It requires constant
examination, questioning, and re-evaluation of policies and systems.
Democratic societies rely on evidence-based decision-making, open public
discourse, and adaptability in response to new information or changing
circumstances. Keith and Danisch's idea that science and democracy are
interconnected suggests that both thrive on open communication, inquiry,
collaboration, and adaptability.

Taken together, these notions of science and democracy lead directly to
Dewey's search for "social democracy"-- a "search for the practical and
intellectual conditions in which appropriate and timely communicative
acts can guide public deliberation, and where public deliberation
simultaneously considers both ends/values and
means/technologies/knowledge [@keith2014, p. 28].

To make this point, Keith and Danisch distinguish between science~1~ and
science~2~:

-   science~1~: "the professional practices of those who pursue
    knowledge, not so much for its own sake but as a professional
    occupation: scientists, whether 'laboratory' or field scientists or
    even social scientists (p. 35).
-   science~2~: "a variety of practices having a strong family
    resemblance to professional science and its epistemology... \[that
    constitute\] a reflective and systematic practice of responding
    individually or corporately to perceived problems" (p. 35)

Following Keith and Danisch, public engagement is at the very least a
process in which the results of science (science1) are communicated to a
broader group of stakeholders so that it may inform their action. Put
another way, public engagement with policy making is a site in which
relevant science is communicated to those involved in making policy with
the goal of informing decision making. Indeed, scientists themselves
often participate in these processes when their expertise or research
are in some way relevant to the decision or policy in question.

More radically, we might also view deliberation properly understood as
scientific (science~2~)-- as a process of inquiry where we collectively
and systematically define problems and put what we know to work in an
attempt to address them. Here, policy makers and other stakeholders are
engaging in communication as part of a scientific process. Rather than
address problems based on a limited definition of the problem and view
of the the relevant evidence, they engage in a deliberative process to
collectively define the problem, recruit and weigh evidence, and
subsequently design an intervention. In this view, the science in
science communication is expanded beyond the common view of scientists
as folks in white lab coats and the facts they produce. Rather, science
is expanded to include problem-solving activities, activities that from
a Deweyan perspective are properly viewed as scientific when pursued in
ideal conditions. For example, imagine a small coastal town facing
increased flooding due to rising sea levels and stronger storms. Instead
of relying on top-down policies, the town organizes a series of public
meetings and workshops. Residents, scientists, policy makers, and other
stakeholders come together to define the problem and propose solutions.

In the two cases of public engagement that follow, science~1~ plays a
critical role. In the first case, for example, decision makers and other
participants must consider what ecologists say about the effects of
light and noise on local species when determining the impacts of
building a currency production facility. In the second case, deciding
how to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas
emissions requires that decision makers know what contributes to current
emissions levels and how different actions are likely to influence those
levels, both of which are questions that professional scientists in
range of disciplines have weighed in on. And through the lens of
science~2~, the decision makers themselves are engaged in science and
science communication to the extent that they are trying to
systematically define and address a social problem.
