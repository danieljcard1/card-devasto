In this article, we have tried to broaden notions of both science and communication. We suggest viewing science not merely as a set of facts associated with fields such as biology or physics but rather as a systematic problem-solving practice. This shift broadens what we communicate about when we engage in science communication. At the same time, we push against unidirectional, transmission notions of communication in favor of a deliberative frame that privileges dialogue and accordingly is attuned to the work of creating the conditions where dialogue happens. Taken together, we argue that these notions of science and communication position public engagement as a significant site of science communication. Toward that end, we explore some of the digital tools and modes that mediate such communication.  

As we argue, the core practices and skills of technical communication are central public engagement work. And we aren't alone. Consider the [U.S. Public Participation Playbook](https://digital.gov/guides/public-participation/). The Playbook consists of a list of 12 "plays" organized around five foci: Establish goals, understand the playing field, design participation, facilitate participation, and evaluate and report [@2020]. Each play consists of a checklist of recommendations that government managers should follow. For example, “Design Participation” includes the plays “Design for inclusiveness” and “Provide multi-tiered paths to participation.” The checklist for the former includes “Provide accessibility options for persons with disabilities, the aging population and others” as well as “Consider both online and offline support, including a physical version and digital package.”

Technical communication research and practice offers valuable insights into effectively conveying complex information to both specialist and non-specialist audiences. We find it particularly interesting that many specific recommendations in the public participation playbook align closely with key areas of focus in recent technical communication scholarship. Below are some examples of these recommendations, along with a selection of relevant work in technical communication:

* Create personas of target participants to understand their needs [@getto2022; @rose2018; @mcmullin2021]
* Talk to underrepresented members of communities; Recognize common dynamics when cultures interact and develop adaptations to service delivery [@gonzales2022a; @acharya2023; @rose2016]
* Determine paths for participation and their requirements, such as accessibility, commenting and annotation [@rose2021; @moorekristen2017; @moore2017; @cagle2019]
* Use Plain Language [@cheung2017; @jones2012; @jones2017]
* Test your content [@kim2023; @h.okeeffe2020; @richards2015]

While science communication is increasingly recognized as an area of interdisciplinary research in its own right, technical communication and writing and rhetoric studies more broadly have much to offer, especially when we look to the spaces where science meets values to inform action.
