In this article, we have tried to broaden notions of both science and communication. We suggest viewing science not merely as a set of facts associated with fields such as biology or physics but rather as a systematic problem-solving practice. This shift broadens what we communicate about when we engage in science communication. At the same time, we push against unidirectional, transmission notions of communication in favor of a deliberative frame that privileges dialogue and accordingly is attuned to the work of creating the conditions where dialogue happens. Taken together, we argue that these notions of science and communication position public engagement as a significant site of science communication. Toward that end, we explore the digital tools and modes that mediate such communication.  

Importantly, technical communication scholars aren’t the only ones who see the core practices of technical communication as central to supporting public engagement. Consider the [U.S. Public Participation Playbook](https://digital.gov/guides/public-participation/). The Playbook consists of a list of 12 "plays" organized around five foci: Establish goals, understand the playing field, design participation, facilitate participation, and evaluate and report [@2020]. Each play consists of a checklist of recommendations that government managers should follow. For example, “Design Participation” includes the plays “Design for inclusiveness” and “Provide multi-tiered paths to participation.” The checklist for the former includes “Provide accessibility options for persons with disabilities, the aging population and others” as well as “Consider both online and offline support, including a physical version and digital package.”

Technical communication research and practice obviously has a lot to say about how best to communicate complex information to specialist and non-specialist audiences, but we are struck by how many of the specific recommendations in the public participation playbook are also critical areas of emphasis within recent technical communication scholarship. Here are just a few of those recommendations and a corresponding sample of technical communication work:

* Create personas of target participants to understand their needs [@getto2022; @rose2018; @mcmullin2021]
* Talk to underrepresented members of communities; Recognize common dynamics when cultures interact and develop adaptations to service delivery [@gonzales2022; @acharya2023; @rose2016]
* Determine paths for participation and their requirements, such as accessibility, commenting and annotation [@rose2021; @moorekristen2017; @moore2017; @cagle2019]
* Use Plain Language [@cheung2017; @jones2012; @jones2017]
* Test your content [@kim2023; @h.okeeffe2020; @richards2015]

To the extent that we are teaching technical communication, we would argue we are also in an important sense teaching skills critical to science communication.
